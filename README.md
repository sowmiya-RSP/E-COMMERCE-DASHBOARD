# E-COMMERCE-DASHBOARD
The dashboard is built using a sample e-commerce dataset that includes detailed information such as customer state, order quantity, sales, and profit  by category, market, and time. The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate the power of Tableau in transforming raw data into actionable business insights through visual storytelling.
